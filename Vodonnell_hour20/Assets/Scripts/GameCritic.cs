//This game might be too easy because its easier to collect the powerupps so you will pick up many more powerups than obstacles
//This game has an issue where you can spam the spacebar to use your phase ability

//I want to add a way so the obstacles subtract more time the longer you keep going 
//I would like to add a cool down effect so it should only be used wisely

//One wow factor would be the unique mechanic of phasing through obstacles 
//Another wow factor that would noted is the endless runner when you're only running in place to avoid loading lag 

//I personally enjoy the fact that this game can go on endlessly
//I also enjoy the addition to powerups adding time and obstacles taking away time

//I can see the tediousness of it being the same randomness each time you restart
//Possibly another tedious part of the game is the lack of style in the background. Other than that, im not entirely sure

//I went ahead and changed the obstacle to a donut and changed the particle system on the powerup to be circling around the object
